# hello-world
This repository will be for the hello-world file because I need to learn how to use github.
I am a young adult learning to code and I'm now making sure I know how to use all of the other tools that should be avaliable to me as I develop myself into a more well rounder coder. I've known of GitHub for a while now but because I got a new MacBook to begin learning Swift, I decided now was time to get GitHub and to learn about it. Especially because I'm one semester out from going to Colorado school of mines and I'll genuinely be surprised if we don't use GitHub for something.
